# Pixomato: Pixelated HTML Animator

Since I developed an artstyle (which I regret) of drawing pixelated cartoon characters, I have decided to develop an animator that helps me draw pixelated characters, but with mobility.

Pixomato is a website where I can create pixelated animations (and maybe vector if you crank the resolution high).

Pixomato is slightly related to PixotatoJS.

## Supported Browsers
I haven't done some research but first you need a decent computer or tablet. You could try either a fast supercomputer or 2000s PC.
But I can tell you that the following browsers are accepted. However I don't know the versions for them.
- Google Chrome (I tested)
- Firefox (I tested)
- Any chromium browser (I haven't tested but I'm pretty sure it will work if Google Chrome works)
- Safari (Only tested on iOS)

## Help
Try really hard to break my website and when you manage to break my website, please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/AlaTomKing/pixomato/issues).
If you used a console to break my website and you think this bug has to be seriously addressed, please let me know!
