# Pixomato

Since I developed an artstyle (which I regret) of drawing pixelated cartoon characters, I have decided to develop an animator that helps me draw pixelated characters, but with mobility.

Pixomato is a website written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript where I can create pixelated animations (and maybe "vector" if you crank the resolution high).

Pixomato is slightly related to PixotatoJS, which is one of my old libraries I forgot it created which draws, you guessed it, pixels.

## Supported Browsers
I haven't done some research but first you need a decent computer or tablet. You could try either a fast supercomputer or 2000s PC.
But I can tell you that the following browsers are accepted. However I don't know the minimum version requirement for them.
- Google Chrome (I tested with Windows)
- Firefox (I tested with Windows)
- Any Chromium browser (I haven't tested but I'm pretty sure it will work if Google Chrome works)
- Safari (Only tested on iOS but it will 99% work)

### Not yet supported browsers
Since Pixomato is made to be extremely versatile and to be supported on roughly all platforms, I decided to consider adding support to discontinued platforms as well via. web browsers.
- Nintendo 2/3DS
- Nintendo Wii U
- Xbox
- PlayStation
- Windows XP?

But then I have to really optimize the web browser. I'm not really sure if some web browsers supports Flexbox.

## Help
