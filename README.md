# Piximator: Pixelated HTML Animator

Since I developed an artstyle (which I regret) of drawing pixelated cartoon characters, I have decided to develop an animator that helps me draw pixelated characters, but with mobility.

Piximator is a website where I can create pixelated animations (and maybe vector if you crank the resolution high).

Piximator is slightly related to Pixotato.js
